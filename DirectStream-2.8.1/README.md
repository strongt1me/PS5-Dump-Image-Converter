# DIRECT STREAM FOR PLAYSTATION 5

A high-performance parallel transfer engine and local browser dashboard for streaming HTTP/HTTPS downloads directly to PlayStation 5 FTP storage, or uploading local Mac files. Runs entirely locally on your Mac with **zero cloud dependencies, zero pip packages, and no Node.js or npm required**.

## Highlights

- **Zero-Copy Direct Streaming**: Download HTTP/HTTPS web links straight into PS5 storage over high-speed LAN without staging gigabytes onto your Mac disk.
- **Pure Python 3.9+ Standard Library**: No third-party runtime dependencies. Uses Python's native `http.client`, `ftplib`, and `asyncio`/threading.
- **Fine-Tuned Parallel Multi-Stream Engine**: Configurable 1–32 concurrent HTTP range workers, dynamic RAM ring buffer (32 MiB to 1024 MiB), and segment chunk sizing (2 MiB to 32 MiB).
- **Speed Diagnostics & Automated Benchmark**: Built-in benchmark engine offering **Quick Scan (~10s)** and **Full Test (~60s Multi-Tier Matrix)** to automatically determine and apply the optimal throughput configuration for your specific network.
- **Local File Transfers**: Native macOS file picker or path input for swift direct uploads.
- **Remote Console File Browser**: Browse, inspect, and navigate folders directly on the console's FTP storage.
- **Resilience & Verification**: Automatic reconnects with exponential backoff, safe partial file handling (`.ps5part`), strict Content-Range verification, and remote file size confirmation before finalizing.
- **Enterprise-Grade Local Security**: Localhost binding only (`127.0.0.1`), per-session token authorization, strict Content Security Policy (CSP), and zero analytics or tracking.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure **Python 3.9 or later** is installed. (Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) if needed).
2. Extract the **entire ZIP or clone the repository**.
3. Double-click **`Launch PS5 Streamer.command`**, or launch **`PS5 Direct Streamer.app`**.
   *(Alternatively, run `python3 ps5_streamer.py` directly from terminal).*
4. The dashboard will automatically open in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?token=...`.
5. Open **Settings**, configure your PS5 IP address, FTP port, and destination folder (e.g. `/data/PS5Direct`), and click **Test connection**.
6. Click **New Transfer**, paste your download URLs or choose a local file, and click **Start queue**.
7. When done, click **Quit app** in the sidebar or Settings page to safely terminate the background server.

> [!NOTE]
> The app is unsigned. If macOS Gatekeeper alerts you on first open, follow the standard macOS Privacy & Security confirmation ("Open Anyway"). If permissions are lost, run `chmod +x launch.sh "Launch PS5 Streamer.command"`.

Optional: Run `bash install_to_applications.sh` to install the app cleanly to `~/Applications` without requiring administrator privileges.

## Performance Presets & Diagnostics

Under **Settings → Transfer engine**, choose from calibrated quick-presets or run the benchmark:

| Preset | Streams | Chunk Size | RAM Buffer | Intended Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | 4 streams | 4 MiB | 64 MiB | Wi-Fi / Standard Broadband |
| **Balanced** | 8 streams | 8 MiB | 128 MiB | Default Fiber / Gigabit LAN |
| **Turbo** | 16 streams | 8 MiB | 256 MiB | High-Speed Fiber / Fast LAN |
| **Max Saturation** | 16 streams | 32 MiB | 512 MiB | Gigabit Ethernet Full Saturation |

### Automated Speed Benchmark
In **Speed diagnostics**, input a test download URL and run:
- **Quick Scan (~10s)**: Evaluates Conservative, Balanced, and Gigabit Turbo tiers.
- **Full Test (~60s)**: Evaluates an 8-tier matrix across varying worker streams, chunk slice sizes, and memory cushions.
- Click **Apply Recommended Settings** to immediately update your engine configuration to the winning profile.

## Transfer Behavior & Integrity

- **Safe Partials (`.ps5part`)**: Transfers write to a uniquely tagged `filename.<job-id>.ps5part`. Only after transmission finishes and the remote size matches the source byte-for-byte does the engine issue an FTP rename (`RNFR`/`RNTO`) to the final name.
- **Safe Resumes**: Resuming inspects the remote partial length, checks strong HTTP validators (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`, or file fingerprint), and continues from the verified byte offset.
- **Existing File Protection**: Overwriting existing destination files is blocked by default unless explicitly toggled on per transfer.
- **Backpressure Pipeline**: The memory ring buffer ensures incoming HTTP chunks never exceed available RAM. If the FTP receiver is slower than the source, downstream backpressure gently pauses HTTP reads to prevent buffer overruns.

---

## Security & Privacy

- **100% Local**: Binds only to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) on a dynamic ephemeral port.
- **Session Authentication**: Every API request requires a cryptographically random session token generated on startup.
- **No Password Persistence**: FTP passwords are held only in process memory during runtime and are never written to disk.
- **Configuration Storage**: User settings and queue state are saved to `~/.ps5-transfer/state.json` with strict owner-only permissions (`0600`).

## Development & Testing

The application requires only Python's standard library. Testing requires `pyftpdlib` for the local FTP test fixtures:

```bash
# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run integration tests (32 tests covering auth, range checks, retries, resume, and bounds)
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

# Sync changes to the Mac application bundle
python3 build_bundle.py
```
